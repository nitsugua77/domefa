# LightMVC Test
A basic MVC application for educational purposes.

## HOWTO

* Add a virtual host definition in the Apache configuration file.
* Add your database configuration to config/config.local.php,
* Load the included test database data/db_schema.sql and data/db_data.sql,
* Run the 'php composer.phar install' command,
* Load the application in your favorite browser.

NOTE: Please make sure that the server can write to the cache/, logs/ and templates_c/ folders!
